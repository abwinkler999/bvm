BVM (Big Visible Metrics)
=========================

BVM helps you generate Big Visible Charts of Sonar Code Metrics for your teamspace.  It is a simple command line utility that parses the data exposed as XML via the Sonar API.  It converts this XML into CSV data that is consumable using [Microsoft Tree Mapper](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/3f3ed95e-26d8-4616-a06c-b609df29756f/default.aspx) or a tool of your choice.
